        <p style="font-family: Arial;">While plants and flowers aren’t exactly the cure to the common cold that has eluded scientists and researchers for centuries, they can certainly help make a dent in the pesky (and sometimes dangerous) illness. During winter months especially – when the lack of humidity breeds infection – flowers add moisture to the air. This moisture helps with dry skin, dry throat and dry cough: all factors that contribute to seasonal illness. This additional moisture contributed by 
          plants and flowers helps prevent, or at least shortens, the life of the common cold and helps people return to good health.At the most basic level, receiving flowers from someone can help lift a mood because it means someone cares, and that is always impactful. But even if the flowers are bought or planted and enjoyed by the same person, they can help improve mood because they look nice and smell good – two factors that are scientifically proven to provide an emotional boost. And an improved mood often leads to improved health. People who are in a good mood are more likely to bounce back from an injury or illness faster. Consider the fact that people often take flowers or plants to hospital patients. And for the most part, hospitals welcome this gesture as it helps patients take important strides toward recovery. 
          Hospitals often have a green space on-site because healthcare professionals recognize the positive impact of exposure to plants and flowers<br>
          Having fresh flowers and/or potted plants around the home or office is linked to an increase in positive energy. The color and scent, specifically, boost energy. Additionally, flowers and plants are proven to increase creativity (they’re linked to an increase in positive energy). Place plants or flowers in a crafting space or any place where a mental boost would be helpful. 
          Sit by a potted plant when reading or doing puzzles or brain exercises. Enjoy the view and benefits of increased mental energy.</p></div>
